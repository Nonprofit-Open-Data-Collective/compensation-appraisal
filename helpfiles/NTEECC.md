### Specialty Descriptions

***

These 7 specialty descriptions represent activities of organizations, such as research, fundraising, and technical assistance, which are common to all broad categories. Most non-profits will not fit any of these specialty descriptions. If your origination fits into one of the specialty categories, please select it. If not, please select “I am a regular non-profit. None of these specialties describe my organization”.

<u> Example 1 </u> 

Say you are a non-profit whose only goal is to provide monetary support to another non-profit that does educational work. Then you would select "Monetary Support - Single Organization".
