### Filter by Organization Type

***

You can filter your comparison set by broad categories, major groups, or specialty organizations. There are 10 broad categories and 26 major groups. The major groups options are more specific subdivisions of the broad categories. [Click here](https://nccs.urban.org/project/national-taxonomy-exempt-entities-ntee-codes#code) for a list of all broad categories and major groups.

Only choose specialty organizations if you want to consider specialty organizations regardless of broad category. (We highly suggest only using this option if you yourself are a specialty organization.)

<u> Example 1 </u>

Say you only want to add health organizations to your comparison set, but is is not important to you if the comparisons organizations are for health care, medical research, mental health, or voluntary health associations. Then you would select: I want to filter by "Broad Category" and then only select "Health". 

<u> Example 2 </u>

Say you only want to add health and human services organizations to your comparison set regardless of major group. Then you would select: I want to filter by "Broad Category" and then select "Health" and "Human Services".

<u> Example 3 </u>

Say you want to include only organizations who do work in either public safety, disaster preparedness & relief or community improvement & capacity building. Then you would select: I want to filter by "Major Group" and only select these options.

<u> Example 4 </u> 

Say you are a non-profit whose only goal is to provide monetary support to another non-profit that does educational work. But in your comparison set, you want to include organizations that provide other non-profits with monetary support. Then you would select: I want to filter by "Specialty Description" then select "Monetary Support - Single Organization" and "Monetary Support - Multiple Organizations".
