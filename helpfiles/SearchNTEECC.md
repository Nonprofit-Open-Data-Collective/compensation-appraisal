### Specialty Descriptions

***

Select any of the specialty descriptions that you want to include in your comparison set. 

<u> Example 1 </u> 

Say you are a non-profit whose only goal is to provide monetary support to another non-profit that does educational work. But in your comparison set, you want to include organizations that provide other non-profits with monetary support. Then you would select: I want to filter by "Specialty Description" then select "Monetary Support - Single Organization" and "Monetary Support - Multiple Organizations". 


<u> Example 2 </u> 

If you want all specialty non-profits in your comparison, press "Select All".
