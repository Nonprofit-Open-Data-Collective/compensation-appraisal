### Hard versus Soft Filtering

***

Hard filtering only includes organizations who match the criteria you specify. Soft matching includes all organizations regardless of your filtering selections, but will prioritize organizations who satisfy to soft matching criteria when we calculated your suggested pay range.

<u> Example 1:  </u>

Say you only want to include organizations in your comparison set whose total employees are less than 200. Then you would select “hard filtering” on the total employees attribute. 

<u> Example 2:  </u>

Say you want to prioritize organizations in your comparison set who have less that 200 employees, but also want to include organizations who have more than 200 employees. Then you would select “soft filtering” on the total employees attribute.

<u> Example 3:  </u>

Say you only want to include organizations in your comparison set who do work either in health or human services. Then in the broad category attribute you would select “hard filtering”.

  
<u> Example 4:  </u>

Say you want to prioritize organizations who do work either in health or human services, but also want to include all nonprofits in all broad categories. Then in the broad category attribute you would select “soft filtering”.
