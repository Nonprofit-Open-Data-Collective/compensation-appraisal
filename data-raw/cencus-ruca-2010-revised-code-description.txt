Population data for census tracts, by urban-rural components, 2010:
U.S. Census Bureau, Census of Population and Housing, 2010. Summary File 1, FTP download: https://www.census.gov/census2000/sumfile1.html
Assignment of census tracts to specific urban areas or to rural status was completed using ESRI's ArcMap software and Census Bureau shape files:

Census tract commuting flows, 2006-2010:
U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2006-2010 Five-year estimates. Special Tabulation: Census Transportation Planning Products, Part 3, Worker Home-to-Work Flow Tables. https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/census_issues/ctpp/data_products/2006-2010_table_list/sheet04.cfm
Tract-to-tract commuting flow files were constructed from ACS data as part of a special tabulation for the Department of Transportation—the Census Transportation Planning Package. To derive estimates for small geographic units such as census tracts, information collected annually from over 3.5 million housing units was combined across 5 years (2006-2010). As with all survey data, ACS estimates are not exact because they are based on a sample. In general, the smaller the estimate, the larger the degree of uncertainty associated with it.
